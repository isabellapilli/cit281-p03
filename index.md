## PROJECT 3

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience interpreting functional descriptions 
   and specifications to complete an assignment
2. Gain experience breaking a project into manageable components
3. Gain experience writing and executing non-web server 
   Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
4. Practice creating and using code modules
5. Practice refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax
6. Gain experience writing and executing web server 
   Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
7. Gain experience using Fastify with the GET verb, 
   routes, and query parameters
8. Gain experience loading a file and using as a web page

Overview: 

You will be creating a "coinage" code module that is capable 
of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing 
the "coinage" code module functionality, you will then update the 
"server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify 
package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web 
page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial 
web page will be loaded from a file.


```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project I was able to create a coinage code module using functions *validDenomination(coin)*, *valueFromCoinObject(obj)*, *valueFromArray(arr)*, and *coinCount(...coinage)*. I then initialized the folder as a node.js folder and installed Fastify then added a few different routes with GET verb.
